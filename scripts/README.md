# SQL Homework 1

Hiya. This is a Ruby script to generate the SQL script needed for the Day 1 homework. You will need two things:

* `people.txt` - A list of student names, one per line, which can be copied from the student personnel file. **Make sure** to mis-spell one name, and to include an imposter somewhere.
* `titles.txt` - A list of movies from Marvel Studios - the ones with the Avengers in them - one per line, with the year in (brackets).

With those things in the `scripts` folder, run in Terminal:

```
ruby master_script.rb
```

This overwrites the file `marvel.sql` in the parent directory. Zip this up with the appropriate version of `homework.md` and give it out to the students.

Best. Homework. Ever.
